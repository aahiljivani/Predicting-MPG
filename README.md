**Predicting-MPG**
Overview
This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive guide to predicting the miles per gallon (MPG) of vehicles using machine learning techniques in Python. Utilizing the scikit-learn library, one of the most popular tools for machine learning, the notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

**Features**
Data Preprocessing: The notebook begins with loading and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between various features and MPG.

Feature Engineering: Techniques to select relevant features and transform them for better model performance.

Model Building: Implementation of different machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn to predict MPG.

Model Evaluation: Techniques for evaluating model performance, including metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and more.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Guide to tuning model parameters for optimal performance.
