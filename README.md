# Predicting MPG Using scikit-learn

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook uses Scikit-Learn to predict the miles per gallon (MPG) of vehicles using machine learning in Python. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The notebook begins with loading and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and normalizing the data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Includes visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the relationships between various features and MPG.

- **Feature Engineering:** Techniques to select relevant features and transform them for better model performance.

- **Model Building:** Implementation of different machine learning algorithms from scikit-learn to predict MPG.

- **Model Evaluation:** Techniques for evaluating model performance, including metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and more.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Guide to tuning model parameters for optimal performance.
